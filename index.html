        	<p class="bio"> Detroit: Become Human is a very good game with even better graphics and story. You play as three androids, two who have deviated from their programming and one who is set to hunt them. As the game progresses, the player can choose whether they want the androids to succeed in their tasks, or fail miserably. Almost everything is up to the player, which gives us a game similar to a cinematic experience with a couple button presses. But it is great nonetheless.</p>
